2.3   What is a Package?
ROS 2 uses packages to organize its programs. You can think of a package as a collection of all the files related to a specific ROS 2 program; all its CPP files, Python files, configuration files, compilation files, launch files, and parameters files. Also, organizing your ROS 2 programs in packages makes sharing them with other developers/users much easier.

In ROS2, you can create two types of packages:

Python packages
CMake (C++) packages
For this course, we will focus on the first type. Python packages will contain Python executables.

Every Python package will have the following structure of files and folders:

package.xml - File containing meta-information about the package (maintainer of the package, dependencies, etc.).

setup.py - File containing instructions for how to compile the package.

setup.cfg - Contains instructions for how to install the package.

src/\<package_name> - This directory is named after your package. You will put all your Python scripts inside this folder. It already contains an empty __init__.py file by default.

Some packages might contain extra folders. For instance, the launch folder contains the package's launch files (you will read more about it later).

To summarize, you should remember the following:

Every ROS2 program that you want to execute is organized into a package.

Every ROS2 program you create must be organized in a package.

Packages are the primary way to organize for ROS2 programs.
